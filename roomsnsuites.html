                                Are you coming to the Orbital Pong Hotel with a close friend?
                                This is most definitely the room for you. This room is cheaper
                                than two rooms and features TWO beds. Not only that but you get
                                a free game of pong against your friend at any point during your
                                visit. If one of you wins the competition, you both get your
                                accomodation free, that's amazing. There is a window that displays
                                whatever you want it to display, including the actual earth, a
                                nice garden, or anything in between.

                                Our most expensive, but most luxury set of rooms. If you have the

                                all our rooms are wonderful, but this one is a step above.

                        <p>
                            We know people have clones these days, what if you want to bring all of 
                            your clones with you on space vaction. We have the room for you, it may
                            look like any other room, but believe us, it caters perfectly to clones,
                            we suggest no more than six clones in the room however, it can be a bit
                            crowded after this point. A couple of clones may have to sleep on the floor
                            but as long as you guys know to rotate, this is your best and cheapest option.
                            Be sure to sign up for the clone vs clone pong competitions if you'd like to
                            verse a group of like minded people.
