                        <h2>The History of Pong</h2>
                        <h3>The Beginning</h3>
                        <p>
                            Pong is a broundbreaking game released by the game manufacturer Atari, Inc in 1972.
                            It is one of the earliest video games and became very popular - launching the video 
                            game industry. Pong is a two dimensional game with two players who control paddles
                            somewhat emulating a game of ping-pong. Players used the paddles to volley a ball
                            between each other across the screen. If you miss the ball, you the opponent will
                            win a point [source britannica.com - work required for referencing].

                            Ralph Baer proposed the idea of simple games people could play on their own television
                            sets in 1958. Atari founder Nolan Bushnell created pong. The company sold more than
                            8,000 pong arcade machines. Pong then got added to a console and became a favourite
                            of many people at home. Though the popularity of pong declined in the 1980s due to 
                            more complex games being made - we're renewing this games popularity.

                        <h3>Current Time</h3>
                        <p>
                            We've developed a pong court in three dimensions, and your hands are the paddle! With Zero-G
                            the ball can float just like the game, get the ball past your opponenet and you win a point
                        </p>
