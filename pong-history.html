            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>
                Pong is a broundbreaking game released by the game manufacturer Atari, Inc in 1972.
                It is one of the earliest video games and became very popular - launching the video
                game industry. Pong is a two dimensional game with two players who control paddles
                somewhat emulating a game of ping-pong. Players used the paddles to volley a ball
                between each other across the screen. If you miss the ball, you the opponent will
                win a point.

                Ralph Baer proposed the idea of simple games people could play on their own television
                sets in 1958. Atari founder Nolan Bushnell created pong. The company sold more than
                8,000 pong arcade machines. Pong then got added to a console and became a favourite
                of many people at home. Though the popularity of pong declined in the 1980s due to
                more complex games being made - we're renewing this games popularity.

            <h2>Current Time</h2>
            <p>
                We've developed pong courts on our space stations solar panels, users are tethered to the space
                station and given a jetpack and training. They will use a small paddle to bat a ball between each
                other. The game has a high skill ceiling and we believe it has potential as a new televised sport.

            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>
                Space pong is the latest and greatest Olympic Sport, competitors from across the globe come Administration
                compete on board the orbital oasis. Viewers around the world will tune in to see the Pong champions. Individual
                and Team categories should be allowed.
