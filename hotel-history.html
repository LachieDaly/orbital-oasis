            <h2>The Beginning</h2>
            <p>
                The Orbital Oasis was built over two decades from a small station in orbit, to the largest
                structures in orbit today. In 1998 when the international space station was launched, we never
                expected it to be converted into a resort in orbit - let alone that it would be maintained for 
                this amount of time. In face the international space station was about to be shutdown due to
                lack of funding. That all changed when the second space race began, and we wanted to secure our
                position in the space frontier.

            <h2>Now</h2>
            <p>
                We're nearly ready for your arrival, we have had athletes test our space pong fields, engineers
                perform all the safety protocols required. Setup our teleporters and recyclable rockets. The 
                Orbital Oasis is available to all across the globe.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>
                We hope to keep getting people to this incredible resort, and expand even further beyond. The orbital oasis
                was a huge accomplishment but we know that there is more we can do. You should expect improvements to the travel
                between earth and oasis, cost reductions. <em>Televised space pong!</em>
